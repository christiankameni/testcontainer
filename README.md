# testcontainer
01_02-service-containers
Use these files to test a service container.

Create a new repo.
Add the files from this directory to the root of the new repo; note there may be a .gitignore file that is hidden...add that file as well.
Move the file service-container.yml into the .github/workflows directory in the new repo.
Once the file is commited, the workflow should be triggered by a push event.
Confirm the workflow runs as expected and includes output for a step named Initialize containers.
